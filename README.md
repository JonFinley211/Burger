# Burger
this application will use mysql and handlebars app to handle the database and routing this will also be deployed using mysql heroku.

# Burger-App — Node, Express, Handlebars

burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.

Uses Heroku for web hosting. 

MVC design pattern, used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and I used Handlebars to generate HTML.

BurgerApp is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they’d like to eat. 

Whenever a user submits a burger’s name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page — waiting to be devoured. 

Each burger in the waiting area will have a ‘Devour it!’ button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right of the page. 

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. 

Future ideas include

-connection to a food database
-barcode reader for food information calories
-break down of overall nutition
-ability to add toppings
-gps locator combined with local food places so if you are at toco bell it will know.
